# Key Project Abbreviations and Glossary

This document defines the core technical abbreviations and concepts used throughout the Lightning Bolt Network project documentation and codebase.

| Abbreviation | Full Term | Definition and Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LBN** | **Lightning Bolt Network** | The overall project name: a next-generation internet architecture focused on unified, self-sovereign, and resilient information fabric. |
| **SSI** | **Self-Sovereign Identity** | A model where individuals control their own digital identities without reliance on a central authority. This is Pillar 1 of the LBN. |
| **DID** | **Decentralized Identifier** | A new type of identifier that is globally unique, persistent, and cryptographically verifiable. Used to identify the Holder in the SSI system. |
| **VC** | **Verifiable Credential** | A tamper-evident credential that can be issued by an Issuer and presented by a Holder to a Verifier. |
| **CBA** | **Content-Based Addressing** | A method of addressing data by its content hash (CID) rather than its location, ensuring immutability and censorship resistance. This is Pillar 2 of the LBN. |
| **CID** | **Content Identifier** | A self-describing identifier used in systems like IPFS to point to content based on its hash. |
| **IPFS** | **InterPlanetary File System** | A peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system, used for CBA in the LBN. |
| **DePIN** | **Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks** | Community-owned, token-incentivized networks for physical infrastructure like compute, storage, and connectivity. This is Pillar 3 of the LBN. |
| **DLT** | **Distributed Ledger Technology** | The decentralized database technology (e.g., blockchain) used by the Phi Chain to anchor DIDs and coordinate DePIN. |
| **PoC** | **Proof-of-Concept** | A realization of a certain method or idea to demonstrate its feasibility. |
| **Nexus** | **Phi Chain Nexus** | The core trust and coordination layer (DLT) for the entire LBN architecture. |
